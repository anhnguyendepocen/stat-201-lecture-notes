    "The discipline of statistics is concerned with proper analysis and description of data, helping people to make better-informed decisions, and reducing the chances of making false claims. Our brain tries to find patterns everywhere, and we frequently jump to conclusions. A proper data analysis requires us to consider the variability of the data, the way the data was collected, the relationship between variables, the type of questions we are trying to answer, and so on. It is not a trivial task at all! In fact, even with the field of statistics as advanced as it is, there are still many discussions that statistical methods have not settled. Why is that? In some cases, we fail to get a complete picture from all angles of a problem. By only analyzing partial information, different people can reach different conclusions, and both might be coherent. After all, partial information can be ambiguous: \n",

They considered 12,763 applications to 101 graduate programs at the University of Berkeley and wanted to answer whether the sex of the applicant had any influence in the decision to admit or reject the applicant.
