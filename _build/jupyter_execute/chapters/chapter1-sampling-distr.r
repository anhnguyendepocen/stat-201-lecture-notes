## Sampling Distribution

different samples give different estimates, therefore we need to study the distribution of these estimates across all possible samples.

### There are uncertainty that stems from the population too

Suppose that we are going to take on individual from the population at random, what is the probability that the variable is between $a$ and $b$? This uncertainty comes from the population itself. Even if you knew the entire population, you couldn't be able to answer this question with certainty, because the individuals of your population also vary.
